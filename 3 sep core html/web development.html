    <h2>web Development</h2>
    <p>Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. This
        involves a combination of different technologies and programming languages, such as HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript, to create web
        pages and make them interactive.
        <br />
        Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and
        back-end development. Front-end development deals with the visual aspects of a website or
        application, including the design, layout, and user interface. This involves working with
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.</p>
