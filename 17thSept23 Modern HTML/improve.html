    <p><b>Use Semantic HTM0 Elements</b>: Using semantic HTML elements helps improve accessibility by providing
        meaningful structure to your content. Semantic elements like header tag,nav,main,article, and footer
        convey the purpose of different sections to assistive technologies, making it easier for users with disabilities to
        navigate and understand the content.</p><br>
    
    <p><b>Use Color withCare</b> : Color plays an important role in web design, but it should not be the only means of
        conveying information. Ensure that color is not the sole indicator of meaning. For example, when using error
        messages, pair color with text that explains the error. Additionally, maintain sufficient color contrast between
        text and background to enhance readability for users with low vision.</p><br>
